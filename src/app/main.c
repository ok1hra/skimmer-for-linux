/* main.c — skimmer-for-linux GTK4/libadwaita front-end (M5, M8).
 *
 * A light window over the headless engine pipeline: the waterfall with its
 * callsign column (M8 — CW Skimmer's layout; the frequency-sorted station
 * list it replaced went 2026-09-05 at Richard's call, the column's tooltip
 * carries its columns) and a bottom pane showing the decode text at the
 * radio's TUNED frequency (the vfo:0,0 the server broadcasts). Decoded text
 * is kept per frequency, so the pane always shows one frequency's history —
 * never a mixed log. A click on a callsign TUNES the radio there (the only
 * radio state the skimmer ever touches, and only on the user's click). No
 * connect button: a scanner probes
 * <host>:<port> (both set in Preferences, persisted; 40001 unless the server
 * says otherwise — SKM-11) and the pipeline follows
 * the server up and down automatically. Engine callbacks fire on
 * engine/network threads and are coalesced into ONE queue drained by a
 * single pending idle (see "marshalled engine events") — the engine stays
 * GLib-only (src/engine/ has no GTK).
 *
 * Part of skimmer-for-linux. GPL-3.0-or-later.
