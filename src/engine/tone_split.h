/* tone_split.h — per-channel carrier splitter (multi-signal channels).
 *
 * Two CW stations closer than ~60 Hz share ONE channelizer channel; the
 * |IQ| envelope then carries the SUM of both keyings (a beat at Δf) and the
 * decoder mutates both calls (live-caught 2026-07-15, the 14036 slot). The
 * splitter watches each channel's Welch-averaged spectrum; when it resolves
 * two or three distinct carriers ≥ ~20 Hz apart it opens one SLOT per
 * carrier — a phase-continuous NCO mix to ~0 Hz plus a narrow FIR whose
 * cutoff follows the carrier spacing — and the owner runs a separate
 * decoder per slot. Carriers closer than the keying bandwidth cannot be
 * separated linearly: the affected slot is flagged CONTESTED so the owner
 * keeps its beat-garbled text away from the callsign candidates.
 *
 * A single-carrier channel stays on a verbatim passthrough (slot 0 == the
 * channel, sample-exact legacy behaviour) — until a second carrier shows,
 * the splitter spends CPU only on the small detection FFT.
