/* callsign.h — callsign extraction + validation (RBN-grade).

 * Pulls candidate callsigns out of decoded text and scores their plausibility:
 * a structural parser with the ITU allocation tables (letter+digit country
 * prefixes are where decode garbage like "T1BR" dies), CW context markers
 * (DE / CQ), repetition counting and an optional known-call dictionary
 * (MASTER.SCP format: one call per line). The RBN feed must never emit
 * unvalidated calls, so this gates spotting (M4 gates M6).
