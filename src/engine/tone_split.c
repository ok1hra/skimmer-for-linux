/* tone_split.c — per-channel carrier splitter. See tone_split.h for the idea.
 *
 * Detection: Hann-windowed 64-point FFTs (hop 32) of the channel IQ,
 * magnitude² EMA'd with a ~2 s time constant (Welch) — keying averages
 * toward its duty cycle while a carrier stays a sharp line. Once a second
 * the peak list is re-evaluated:
 *
 *   floor   = median bin power (a carrier + sidebands occupy few of 64 bins),
 *   peak    = interpolated local max ≥ 8 dB over the floor, within ±60 Hz,
 *   carrier = peak that is NOT a keying sideband. Hard 50 %-duty keying puts
 *             the first sideband pair only ~4 dB under the carrier — far
 *             above any noise rule, so naive peak-picking would split every
 *             strong signal against its own keying. Sidebands come in
 *             SYMMETRIC pairs about their carrier; a real second station has
 *             no mirror twin. Any peak whose mirror about an accepted
 *             stronger carrier holds ≥ 0.3× its power is dropped.
 *
 * Split engages after 2 consecutive evals agree (≥2 carriers ≥ 22 Hz apart,
 * stable within ±10 Hz) and collapses when a slot's carrier stays unseen
 * for 90 s: a QSO pair alternates overs, so a slot must ride out the other
 * side's whole transmission — an idle slot only costs one parked decoder.
 *
 * Two lines closer than the engage bar overlap in keying bandwidth and
 * cannot be separated linearly (that needs joint demodulation / SIC — a
 * later stage); the affected slot is flagged CONTESTED instead, so the
 * pipeline can at least stop the beat mutations from reaching the callsign
 * candidates.
 *
 * Slot routing: phase-continuous NCO to ~0 Hz, then a 31-tap windowed-sinc
 * lowpass whose cutoff rides the nearest-carrier spacing,
 * clamp(0.55·Δf, 10, 32) Hz — near the keying bandwidth the filter trades
 * edge softness for rejection; the decoder tolerates soft edges far better
 * than a beating neighbour.
