   * rows per over, a quarter of the way down again.

   *     stops and resumes on the first live row;
   *   – a zero run at either end → a mute edge inside the window: the row
   *     comes from the live part alone, through the cut path below (fresh
   *     Hann, floor renormalised) — a chopped window would smear every
   *     strong line across the row. Under n/32 frames the full window's own
   *     taper already leaves the edge no weight (the late-label figure
