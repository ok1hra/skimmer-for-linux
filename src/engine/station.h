/* station.h — per-frequency station tracker.

 * Aggregates decode events into stations: a callsign heard at a frequency,

 * call decoded on neighbouring channels (splatter of a strong signal) folds
 * into the strongest report. Feeds the UI list, the spot feeder and the RBN
 * feed. Mode-agnostic. Engine-thread only.
